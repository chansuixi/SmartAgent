# LLM-Powered Multi-Agent for Smart Contract Auditing!

## 🏛️  LLM-SmartAudit System

### Framework
SmartAgent is a skill-integrated multi-agent framework that systematically incorporates expert auditing skills with large language model (LLM)-based smart contract vulnerability detection.

In SmartAgent, a skill encapsulates expert auditing experience for a specific vulnerability pattern, including structured vulnerability knowledge, analysis workflows, and representative code examples commonly used by human auditors. Rather than treating vulnerability detection as a monolithic task, SmartAgent integrates these skills with LLM-based analysis by decomposing the auditing process into specialized roles that collaboratively analyze smart contract code in a closed-loop workflow.

### Key Features

- 🔍 Automated vulnerability detection framework
- 📊 expert auditing skill integration
- 🛡️ novel vulnerability exploration
- 🖥️ a role-specialized detection workflow
